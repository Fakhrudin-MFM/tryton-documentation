Tryton Documentation
####################

This Tryton documentation consists of several different guides and reference
manuals.  Each one is intended for use by a different audience.  Hopefully you
will find it obvious which one you need to read, but if in doubt start with
the :ref:`user/index:User Guide`, and then dip into the
:ref:`administration/index:Administration and Configuration Guide` as required.

There is a lot of information contained within this documentation, and Tryton
is a constantly improving and evolving system.  It can be hard to keep up with
these changes, so if you happen to spot anything that you think is wrong then
please get in touch so we can make sure this documentation is both accurate and
complete.
