Tryton Documentation
====================


.. **************************************************************************

.. warning::

    This documentation is very much a work in progress.  There are many
    sections that have not yet been written, and plenty of others that do
    not even have an entry in the contents yet.

    Any help to complete this documentation would be greatly appreciated,
    whether that is pull requests to correct or complete parts of it, or
    funding to help provide more time to work on it.

.. **************************************************************************


This documentation repository can be used to build Tryton_ documentation for a
range of different purposes.  It uses some sphinx extensions that allow it to
get information about a Tryton installation directly from a ``trytond``
server, and enable it to generate documentation that is tailored to a
particular set of activated modules.

Installation
------------

This documentation repository doesn't need installing, but to generate the
documentation you will need a working Python_ installation.

The documentation is generated by a program called Sphinx_ and a couple of
Sphinx extensions: sphinxcontrib-inherit_ and sphinxcontrib-tryton_.
The easiest way of installing these is by using pip and the requirements.txt
file that is provided:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/
.. _sphinxcontrib-inherit: https://bitbucket.org/libateq/sphinxcontrib-inherit
.. _sphinxcontrib-tryton: https://bitbucket.org/libateq/sphinxcontrib-tryton


Building the Documentation
--------------------------

This package is supplied with a ``conf.py`` file that is configured to attempt
to build documentation for a base Tryton system with no modules installed.
It will attempt to start and initialise a ``trytond`` service on the local
computer and then use that to obtain information about fields, modules, and
other components.

So, as a rough guide, to get you started you should:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd tryton-documentation
    python -m venv --prompt tryton-documentation .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install trytond
    sphinx-build . docs

The resulting documentation will be placed in a folder called ``docs``.

Documentation for existing systems, for a specific set of modules, and with
screenshots from the Desktop client or Web client can also be built.  For this
you will need to ensure you have the right packages installed and have setup
the correct configuration in the ``conf.py`` file.  See the
sphinxcontrib-tryton_ documentation for more details.
