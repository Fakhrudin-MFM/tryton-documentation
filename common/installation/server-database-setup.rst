To work correctly the Tryton server needs to be able to connect to an
initialised database.

If you have followed the installation instructions above you should find you
have installed PostgreSQL onto your machine.  You can then
:ref:`administration/installation/database/postgresql:Setup a Database` on
your PostgreSQL database server, and use that with Tryton.

The :ref:`administration/installation/database/index:Database Installation`
section provides information on other database servers that you can use with
Tryton, and how to setup a database with them.
