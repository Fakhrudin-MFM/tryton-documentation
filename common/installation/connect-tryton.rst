Now your system is up and running you can use the web browser on the computer
that your Tryton system is running on to connect to it, it can be accessed at
http://localhost:8000/.

If you have
:ref:`installed the desktop client <administration/installation/client/index:Client Installation>`
then you can use this as well.  You need to enter ``localhost:8000`` as the
host, ``tryton`` as the database, and ``admin`` as the user name.

When you have logged in you will be greeted with the standard Tryton menu on
the left, and a "Module Configuration" wizard on the right that will prompt
you to add some :ref:`Users <administration/system/user:User Management>`
and activate any :ref:`administration/system/modules:Modules` that you would
like to use.  Information on the basics of using and navigating through your
Tryton system can be found in the :ref:`user/index:User Guide`.
