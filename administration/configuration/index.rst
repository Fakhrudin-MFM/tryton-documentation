Configuration
=============

The server, and any other
:ref:`administration/services/index:Tools and Services` that you want to run,
may need to be configured before they can be launched.  Generally all the
configuration options have sane defaults, but there will normally be at least
a few options that need to be set to enable Tryton to work correctly.
Along with the configuration option, the location and amount of logging the
services do can also be configured.
