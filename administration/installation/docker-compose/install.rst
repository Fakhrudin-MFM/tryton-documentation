Install Docker and Docker Compose
---------------------------------

In order to run Tryton using Docker Compose you must first install Docker and
Docker Compose.  How you do this will depend on the Operating System or
distribution that you are running.  The `official Docker Documentation`_
is a great source of information, and includes the installation guides for each
different operating system and distribution:

* `Docker Desktop for Windows 10`_
* `Docker Desktop for macOS`_
* Linux:

    * `Docker Engine - Community for CentOS`_
    * `Docker Engine - Community for Debian`_
    * `Docker Engine - Community for Fedora`_
    * `Docker Engine - Community for Ubuntu`_

With Docker and Docker Compose installed you are now ready to define the basic
services that are required for a working Tryton system.
